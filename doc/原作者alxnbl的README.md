**OneNote Md Exporter** is a console application running on Windows that exports your OneNote notebooks in different markdown formats.

This tool is usefull to :
* migrate from OneNote to an other note management app based on markdown file formats
* backup your OneNote Notebooks in an interoperable and open file format
  
# Requirements

The tool requires OneNote and Word from the Microsoft Office suite. 
[OneNote for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/onenote-for-windows-10/9wzdncrfhvjl) is not supported.

# Getting started

# Export formats supported
